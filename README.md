# Netstat

Netstat is a tool for computing statistics (mean, median, 
diameter and effective diameter) for large networks.

## Installation

1. Change directory to the package directory and run:

    ```
    python install_venv.py
    ```
    
    The script will create a virtual environment `.venv`
    inside the package and install required packages using pip.
    It will also build and install `netstat` itself.
    
2. Activate the virtual environment:

    ```
    . ./venv/bin/activate
    ```
    
    Alternatively, you can create your own virtual environment or
    even use sistem packages (not recommended).
    
## Usage

    ToDo: 
    
## Platform Issues

1. The script `install_venv.py` only works with Linux and Mac.
